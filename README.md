# Sirius

[Why so serious?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_5dP_83O7o) Emoji are all over the place, but they can be a burden for accessibility. Look at that tiny yellow face and figure out if it's crying in joy or horror...

Things would be easier if all the emoji had nice `aria-label` attributes that showed up on hover, right? While Sirius won't generate HTML for you, it will give you the Unicode name of any character you give it.
